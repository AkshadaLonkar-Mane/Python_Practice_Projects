## Basic Calculator

The Basic Calculator project is a simple application designed to perform fundamental arithmetic operations. This calculator can handle addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, allowing users to perform basic calculations with ease. The project introduces essential programming concepts such as handling user input, performing operations based on user choices, and displaying results.

### Features

- **Addition**: Computes the sum of two numbers.
- **Subtraction**: Calculates the difference between two numbers.
- **Multiplication**: Multiplies two numbers to get the product.
- **Division**: Divides one number by another, handling division by zero gracefully.

### How It Works

1. **User Input:** The user inputs two numbers and selects an operation.
2. **Processing:** The application performs the selected operation on the numbers.
3. **Output:** The result is displayed to the user.

This project is an excellent way to get comfortable with basic programming constructs and user interaction.
